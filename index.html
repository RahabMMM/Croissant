    <p>
        A designer's muse becomes a mannequin for whom they draw creative inspiration.
         They help them navigate the often convoluted design process and can be credited for
          inspiring the looks we see take the runway each season,
         the conceptual campaigns and the overarching trends that sweep through the industry.
